### probabilistic distributions over the whole real line
Why many distributions over the real number line decrease towards both ends? Why there can not be a uniform distribution over the whole real line? Because we have to make sure the PDF integrates to one over entire space.

In other words, the improper integral 
\\[\int^\infty_-\infty\tilde{p}(x)dx\\]
has to converge, which means, the limit of anti-derivative of the unnormalized distribution \\(\tilde{p}\\) at (negative) infinity has to converge to a finite number.


### cmake runtime shared library search path  
Set [CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH.html) to true.
