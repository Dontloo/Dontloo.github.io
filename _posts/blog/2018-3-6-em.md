Because we can not observe the true value of latent variables, we estimate a distribution $q_i(z_i)$ as `completions` (of the missing value $z$) for each data point, then optimize the sum of expectations $$\sum_z E_{z_i}[\log \frac{p(x,z|\theta)}{q(z_i)}]$$ as an lower bound (Jensen's inequality) of the data likelihood $p(X|\theta)$.
