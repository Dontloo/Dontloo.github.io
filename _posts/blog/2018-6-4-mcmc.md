## Markov Chains
By Markov chains in this blog we refer to [discrete-time homogeneous Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Discrete-time_Markov_chain).

**Discrete-time Markov chains** 
A discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables \\(\{X_1, X_2, X_3, ...\}\\) with the Markov property, namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states
\\[P(X_{n+1}|X_n,â€¦,X1) = P(X_{n+1}|X_n)\\]

**Homogeneous chains**
A homogeneous Markov chain is one that does not evolve in time, that is, its transition probabilities are independent of the time step \\(n\\)
\\[P(X_{n+1}|X_n) \text{ is same} \forall n \leq 0 \\]

## Water Lily Example
To illustrate we'll take a look at the water lily example from the [Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning) on cousera.
[lily]
There a frog in a pond that jumps between two water lilies according to some probability. As shown in the graph, if the frog is at the left (L) lily at time \\(n\\) then it has 0.7 probability to jump to the right (R) lily and 0.3 probability to stay till the next round \\(n+1\\), if the frog is at the right lily then probability for staying and jumping are even (0.5).

Here the domain of variable \\(X\\) is \\(\[L, R\]\\), and we have \\(P(X_{n+1}=L|X_n=L)=0.3\\), \\(P(X_{n+1}=R|X_n=L)=0.7\\), \\(P(X_{n+1}=R|X_n=R)=0.5\\), \\(P(X_{n+1}=L|X_n=R)=0.5\\).
