This post is about some understandings of the Central Limit Theorem and (un)related stuff. 

## Central Limit Theorem
As defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), its basic form is
\\[ \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2)\\]
saying that as \\(n\\) approaches infinity, the random variables \\( \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \\) converge in distribution to a normal \\( N(0,\sigma^2) \\).

The interesting part is the scaling factor \\( \sqrt{n} \\),
for a larger scaling factor the whole term \\( \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \\) always goes to zero,
for a smaller scaling factor the term will blow up to infinity, only for \\( \sqrt{n} \\) it converges to a distribution.

It can be proved using the fact convergence of [moment-generating functions (MGFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function) implies the convergence in distribution,
i.e. to prove \\( M(\sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu)/\sigma) = M(N(0,1))\\). 
Here's a very good lecture on that [Lecture 29: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem | Statistics 110](https://youtu.be/OprNqnHsVIA).

So we know for \\(n\\) i.i.d variables with zero mean, as \\(n\\) gets larger, its mean gets to zero (the law of large numbers) and its sum goes to positive/negative infinity.

CTL is useful in many areas including [the Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Wiener_process_as_a_limit_of_random_walk),
which is often used to model the stock price, see [this blog](http://epchan.blogspot.jp/2016/04/mean-reversion-momentum-and-volatility.html) and [this question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/308545/95569).

## Sum of normally distributed random variables
The \\( \sqrt{n} \\) scaling factor also applies to summing a finite number of normally distributed random variables with the same variance.
As described in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_normally_distributed_random_variables),
if \\( x_1 \~ N(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2) \\), \\( x_2 \~ N(\mu_2,\sigma_2^2) \\) and \\( y = x_1+x_2 \\),
then \\(y \~ N(\mu_1+\mu_1,\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2)\\).

If \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) follows the same distribution, then \\(y \~ N(2\mu,2\sigma^2)\\).
Note that this is different from applying a change of variable \\(z=2x\\), which gives \\(z \~ N(2\mu,4\sigma^2)\\).

For \\(n\\) normally distributed random variables with the same variance, it follows
\\(\sum x_n-\sum \mu_n \~ N(0, n\sigma^2)\\), which is equal to 
\\[ \sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu) \~ N(0,\sigma^2).\\]
