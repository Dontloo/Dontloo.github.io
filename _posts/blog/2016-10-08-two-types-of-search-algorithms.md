There're two types of search algorithms, tree based and hash based.
Perhaps the simplest applications of these are [`tree maps`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html) and [`hash maps`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html).

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
