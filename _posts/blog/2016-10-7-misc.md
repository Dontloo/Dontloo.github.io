### probabilistic distributions over the whole real line
Why many distributions over the real number line decrease towards both ends (e.g. Cauchy, Gaussian)? Why there can not be a uniform distribution over the over entire space? Because we have to make sure the PDF integrates to one.

In other words, the improper integral 
\\[\int^\infty_{-\infty}\tilde{p}(x)dx\\]
has to converge, which means, the limit of the anti-derivative of the unnormalized distribution \\(\tilde{p}\\) at (negative) infinity has to converge to a finite number. For instance, \\(\tilde{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\) (Cauchy) does and \\(\tilde{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1+|x|}\\) does not.


### pitfalls
**CMake: runtime shared library search path**  
Set [CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH.html) to true.  
**CUDA: no CUDA-capable device is detected**  
Simply rebooting your system might just solve the problem, ref: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17236325/3041068  
**CMake: 100 errors out of nowhere**
Remove the `CMakeCache.txt` file and make again.
